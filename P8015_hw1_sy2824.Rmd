This is the first homework of data science. 

```{r library, include=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
```

# Problem 1

## Create a data frame comprised of:

A random sample of size 10 from a uniform[0, 5] distribution

```{r data_frame_1}
uniform_ten = runif(10,min = 0,max = 5)
```

A logical vector indicating whether elements of the sample are greater than 2

```{r}
def_larger_than_two = ifelse(uniform_ten > 2 , TRUE, FALSE)

```

A (length-10) character vector

```{r}
char_leng_ten = c("a" , "b" , "c" , "e" , "f", "g", "h", "i", "j", "k")

```

A (length-10) factor vector
```{r}
fac_leng_ten = factor(c("a" , "b" , "c" , "e" , "f", "g", "h", "i", "j", "k"))

```

Create a dataframe consists of these variables:
```{r}

```
