A random sample of size 10 from a uniform\[0, 5\] distribution

``` r
x = rnorm(10)
```

A logical vector indicating whether elements of the sample are greater than 2

``` r
def_larger_than_two = ifelse (x > 2 , TRUE, FALSE)
```

A (length-10) character vector

``` r
leng_ten = c("a" , "b" , "c" , "e" , "f", "g", "h", "i", "j", "k")
length(leng_ten)
```
